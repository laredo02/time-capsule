# 🏺 Artifacts

> **Status:** Archived / Deprecated

A collection of recovered code, unfinished projects, and proofs of concept recovered from an old hard drive. 

These projects date back to my high school years. While much of this repository consists of nonsensical scripts and early learning experiments, there are a few "jewels" and Competitive Programming solutions hidden in the mix that pave the way for how I code today.
